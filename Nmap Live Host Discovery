**Live Hosts**
nmap -sL TARGETS (If you want to check the list of hosts that Nmap will scan)

Example:
namp -sL 10.10.0-255.101-125




**ARP**
nmap -PR -sn MACHINE_IP/24 (-PR indicates that you only want an ARP scan)

arp-scan --localnet  OR  arp-scan -l 
(This command will send ARP queries to all valid IP addresses on your local networks.)




**ICMP**
To use ICMP echo request to discover live hosts, add the option -PE. (Remember to add -sn if you donâ€™t want to follow that with a port scan)
nmap -PE -sn MACHINE_IP/24

-PP (option required to tell Nmap to use ICMP Timestamp to discover live hosts)

-PM (option required to tell Nmap to use ICMP Address Mask to discover live hosts)

-PE (option required to tell Nmap to use ICMP Echo to discover live hosts)
