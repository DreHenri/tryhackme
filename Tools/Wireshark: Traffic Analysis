ARP Poisoning/Spoofing (A.K.A. Man In The Middle Attack)

Global search - arp
Opcode 1: ARP requests - arp.opcode == 1
Opcode 2: ARP responses - arp.opcode == 2
Hunt: Arp scanning - arp.dst.hw_mac==00:00:00:00:00:00
Hunt: Possible ARP poisoning detection - arp.duplicate-address-detected or arp.duplicate-address-frame
Hunt: Possible ARP flooding from detection - ((arp) && (arp.opcode == 1)) && (arp.src.hw_mac == target-mac-address)



DHCP Analysis

Global search - dhcp or bootp
"DHCP Request" packets contain the hostname information - dhcp.option.dhcp == 3
"DHCP ACK" packets represent the accepted requests - dhcp.option.dhcp == 5
"DHCP NAK" packets represent denied requests - dhcp.option.dhcp == 6
"DHCP Request" options for grabbing the low-hanging fruits - dhcp.option.hostname contains "keyword"
"DHCP ACK" options for grabbing the low-hanging fruits: - dhcp.option.domain_name contains "keyword"



NetBIOS (NBNS) Analysis

Global search - nbns
"NBNS" options for grabbing the low-hanging fruits - nbns.name contains "keyword"



Kerberos Analysis

Global search - kerberos
User account search: CNameString: The username - kerberos.CNameString contains "keyword"  ;  kerberos.CNameString and !(kerberos.CNameString contains "$" )



ICMP Analysis 

Global search - icmp
"ICMP" options for grabbing the low-hanging fruits: Packet length, ICMP destination addresses, Encapsulated protocol signs in ICMP payload - data.len > 64 and icmp
