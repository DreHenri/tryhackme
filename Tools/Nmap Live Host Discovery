**Live Hosts**
nmap -sL TARGETS (If you want to check the list of hosts that Nmap will scan)

Example:
namp -sL 10.10.0-255.101-125




**ARP**
nmap -PR -sn MACHINE_IP/24 (-PR indicates that you only want an ARP scan)

arp-scan --localnet  OR  arp-scan -l 
(This command will send ARP queries to all valid IP addresses on your local networks.)




**ICMP**
To use ICMP echo request to discover live hosts, add the option -PE. (Remember to add -sn if you don‚Äôt want to follow that with a port scan)
nmap -PE -sn MACHINE_IP/24

-PP (option required to tell Nmap to use ICMP Timestamp to discover live hosts)

-PM (option required to tell Nmap to use ICMP Address Mask to discover live hosts)

-PE (option required to tell Nmap to use ICMP Echo to discover live hosts)




**TCP**
nmap -PS (TCP SYN ping)
Example: 
-PS21 will target port 21
-PS21-25 will target ports 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25
-PS80,443,8080 will target the three ports 80, 443, and 8080

nmap -PA (TCP ACK ping)
Example: 
-PA21, -PA21-25 and -PA80,443,8080




**UDP**
nmap -PU
sudo nmap -PU -sn
-sn: Tells Nmap to perform host discovery only ‚Äî no port scanning.
Sends UDP ping probes (by default to port 40125) to check if the host is up




**masscan**
Masscan is quite aggressive with the rate of packets it generates. The syntax is quite similar: -p can be followed by a port number, list, or range.

masscan MACHINE_IP/24 -p443




**Reverse-DNS Lookup**
-n	‚ùå Skip reverse DNS lookups (faster, stealthier).
-R	üîç Do DNS lookups for all hosts, even if they‚Äôre offline.
--dns-servers <IP>	üåê Use a specific DNS server instead of the system default.
