Cyber Kill Chain:

Reconnaissance – The attacker gathers information about the target to identify vulnerabilities or entry points.

Weaponization – The attacker creates a malicious payload, often by pairing malware with an exploit or delivery method.

Delivery – The attacker transmits the malicious payload to the victim, typically via email, websites, or infected USBs.

Exploitation – The payload is triggered, exploiting a vulnerability to gain access to the target system.

Installation – The attacker installs malware or backdoors to maintain persistence on the victim’s system.

Command and Control (C2) – The compromised system connects to the attacker’s server to receive instructions or send data.

Actions on Objectives – The attacker performs their end goals, such as data theft, espionage, or system destruction.





The Unified Kill Chain:


| #  | Stage                | Description                                                                                  |
|----|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2  | Resource Development | Preparatory activities aimed at setting up the infrastructure required for the attack.      |
| 3  | Delivery             | Techniques resulting in the transmission of a weaponized object to the targeted environment.|
| 4  | Social Engineering   | Techniques aimed at the manipulation of people to perform unsafe actions.                   |
| 5  | Exploitation         | Techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in systems that may, amongst others, result in code execution. |
| 6  | Persistence          | Any access, action or change to a system that gives an attacker persistent presence.        |
| 7  | Defense Evasion      | Techniques an attacker may specifically use for evading detection or avoiding other defenses.|
| 8  | Command & Control    | Techniques that allow attackers to communicate with controlled systems within a target network.|
| 9  | Pivoting             | Tunneling traffic through a controlled system to other systems that are not directly accessible.|
| 10 | Discovery            | Techniques that allow an attacker to gain knowledge about a system and its network environment.|
| 11 | Privilege Escalation | Techniques that provide an attacker with higher permissions on a system or network.         |
| 12 | Execution            | Techniques that result in execution of attacker-controlled code on a local or remote system.|
| 13 | Credential Access    | Techniques resulting in the access of, or control over, system, service or domain credentials.|
| 14 | Lateral Movement     | Techniques that enable an adversary to horizontally access and control other remote systems.|
| 15 | Collection           | Techniques used to identify and gather data from a target network prior to exfiltration.    |
| 16 | Exfiltration         | Techniques that result or aid in an attacker removing data from a target network.           |
| 17 | Impact               | Techniques aimed at manipulating, interrupting or destroying the target system or data.     |
| 18 | Objectives           | Socio-technical objectives of an attack that are intended to achieve a strategic goal.      |
