Statements:

select * from users;


select username,password from users;


select * from users LIMIT 1;


select * from users where username='admin';


select * from users where username != 'admin';


select * from users where username='admin' or username='jon';


select * from users where username='admin' and password='p4ssword';


select * from users where username like 'a%';
This returns any rows with a username beginning with the letter a.


select * from users where username like '%n';
This returns any rows with a username ending with the letter n.


select * from users where username like '%mi%';
This returns any rows with a username containing the characters mi within them.


SELECT name,address,city,postcode from customers UNION SELECT company,address,city,postcode from suppliers;
The UNION statement combines the results of two or more SELECT statements to retrieve data from either single or multiple tables; 
the rules to this query are that the UNION statement must retrieve the same number of columns in each SELECT statement, the columns have to be of a similar data type, and the column order has to be the same.



Using the following SQL Statement, we can gather the results from the two tables and put them into one result set:

SELECT name,address,city,postcode from customers UNION SELECT company,address,city,postcode from suppliers;




INSERT
The INSERT statement tells the database we wish to insert a new row of data into the table.

insert into users (username,password) values ('bob','password123');

"into users" tells the database which table we wish to insert the data into, "(username,password)" provides the columns we are providing data for 
and then "values ('bob','password');" provides the data for the previously specified columns.




UPDATE
The UPDATE statement tells the database we wish to update one or more rows of data within a table. You specify the table you wish to update using "update %tablename% SET" 
and then select the field or fields you wish to update as a comma-separated list such as "username='root',password='pass123'" then finally, similar to the SELECT statement, 
you can specify exactly which rows to update using the where clause such as "where username='admin;".

update users SET username='root',password='pass123' where username='admin';




DELETE
The DELETE statement tells the database we wish to delete one or more rows of data. 

delete from users where username='martin';


delete from users;
Because no WHERE clause was being used in the query, all the data was deleted from the table.







The URL for each blog entry may look something like this:

https://website.thm/blog?id=1

SELECT * from blog where id=1 and private=0 LIMIT 1;
 the SQL statement above is looking in the blog table for an article with the id number of 1 and the private column set to 0
