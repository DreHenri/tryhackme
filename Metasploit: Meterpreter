Meterpreter will run on the target system and act as an agent within a command and control architecture. You will interact with the target operating system and files and use Meterpreter's specialized commands.

Meterpreter runs on the target system but is not installed on it. It runs in memory and does not write itself to the disk on the target.



getpid command returns the process ID with which Meterpreter is running.

EX:
meterpreter > getpid 
Current pid: 1304

If we list processes running on the target system using the ps command, we see PID 1304 is spoolsv.exe and not Meterpreter.exe, as one might expect.

    sysinfo: Gets information about the remote system, such as OS

Others Commands (these will be listed under different menu categories in the help menu)

    idletime: Returns the number of seconds the remote user has been idle
