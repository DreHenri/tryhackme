OS release information - /etc/os-release

User accounts - /etc/passwd  ;  cat /etc/passwd| column -t -s :

Group Information - /etc/group

passwords - /etc/shadow

Sudoers List - /etc/sudoers

Login information -  /var/log/wtmp  ;  /var/log/btmp 
btmp file saves information about failed logins
wtmp keeps historical data of logins
These files are not regular text files that can be read using cat, less or vim; instead, they are binary files, which have to be read using the last

Authentication logs - /var/log/auth.log
It can be read using the cat utility, however, given the size of the file, we can use tail, head, more or less utilities to make it easier to read. 

Hostname - /etc/hostname

Timezone -  /etc/timezone

Network Configuration - /etc/network/interfaces

Active network connections - netstat

Running processes - ps aux

DNS information - /etc/hosts
The file /etc/hosts contains the configuration for the DNS name assignment.
The information about DNS servers that a Linux host talks to for DNS resolution is stored in the resolv.conf file. Its location is /etc/resolv.conf


Cron jobs - /etc/crontab
Cron jobs are commands that run periodically after a set amount of time.

Service startup - /etc/init.d
Like Windows, services can be set up in Linux that will start and run in the background after every system boot. A list of services can be found in the /etc/init.d directory. 

.Bashrc - ~/.bashrc
When a bash shell is spawned, it runs the commands stored in the .bashrc file. This file can be considered as a startup list of actions to be performed. Hence it can prove to be a good place to look for persistence. 
System-wide settings are stored in /etc/bash.bashrc and /etc/profile files, so it is often a good idea to take a look at these files as well.


Sudo execution history - /var/log/auth.log
All the commands that are run on a Linux host using sudo are stored in the auth log.
cat /var/log/auth.log* |grep -i COMMAND|tail

Bash history - ~/.bash_history 
Any commands other than the ones run using sudo are stored in the bash history. Every user's bash history is stored separately in that user's home folder.

Files accessed using vim - ~/.viminfo
The Vim text editor stores logs for opened files in Vim in the file named .viminfo in the home directory.

Syslog - /var/log/syslog
The Syslog contains messages that are recorded by the host about system activity.
Since the Syslog is a huge file, it is easier to use tail, head, more or less utilities to help make it more readable.

Third-party logs - /var/log/
