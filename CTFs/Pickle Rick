# Rick and Morty CTF Walkthrough

I went to the website and the first thing I checked was: **View Source**. I quickly found the username:

**Username:** `R1ckRul3s`

---

After that, I ran **gobuster** and found some interesting directories:

```
/assets               (Status: 301)
/index.html           (Status: 200)
/robots.txt           (Status: 200)
/server-status        (Status: 403)
/login.php
```

`robots.txt` only had one word related to the TV show, so I decided to try that as the **password**.  
I went to the **login page** and got in.

---

I was greeted with the **command panel** and some other tabs that only Rick had permissions for.

I ran a few commands:

```
whoami
pwd
sudo -l
ls -la
```

I found the **first flag** inside a `.txt` file, but the `cat` command wasn't working.  
I tried `head` and `tail`, but no luck.  
I finally tried `less`, and it opened the file with the **first flag**.

---

Then, `clue.txt` gave me another idea where to start: **The file system**.

The first thing I did was check the `/root` directory, but I had to run it as `sudo` for it to work.  
The **third flag** was there in a `.txt` file.

---

After a lot of digging through the file system: `/etc`, `/bin`, `/usr`, `/tmp`...  
I finally went to the `/home` directory to find the **final flag**. But I couldn't retrieve it with the `less` command at first.

It took me a while to figure out the trick: use the `less` command with quotes around the full path, because the filename had a **space** in it.  
That worked!

âœ… **All flags captured!**
