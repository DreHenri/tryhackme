## 1. Summary  
**IP/URL:** [Target IP Hidden]  
**Service/Ports:** 80/HTTP  
**Entry Point:** URL parameter manipulation on `/profile.php?user=guest`  
**Privilege Escalation:** Not required  
**Outcome:** Retrieved the flag by changing `user=guest` to `user=admin`

## 2. Methodology  
Following the PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard):  
1. Reconnaissance  
2. Enumeration  
3. Exploitation  
4. Post-Exploitation  
5. Reporting

---

## 3. Reconnaissance  
On the login page, a hint said:  
"Don't have an account? Use the guest account! (Ctrl+U)"  
This suggested using view-source or directly trying a known guest login.

---

## 4. Enumeration  
Logged in using guest credentials  
Redirected to: /profile.php?user=guest  
Reviewed URL structure and immediately tested for insecure parameter usage

---

## 5. Exploitation  
Changed the URL from:  
/profile.php?user=guest  
To:  
/profile.php?user=admin  
Result:  
Successfully accessed the admin page  
Displayed message:  
"Hi, admin. Welcome to your site. The flag is: flag{**********************}"

---

## 6. Privilege Escalation  
Not applicable â€” no need to escalate privileges, direct access obtained via IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)

---

## 7. Post Exploitation  
Flag was directly presented on the admin page  

No system access or lateral movement needed

---

## 8. Flags / Proof  
Flag: flag{**********************}

---

## 9. Mitigations  
| Vulnerability                    | Risk   | Suggested Mitigation                           |  
|----------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------|  
| Insecure Direct Object Reference | High   | Use session validation and server-side checks  |  
| Parameter tampering              | High   | Avoid trusting client-side data for access control |

---

## 10. Notes  
Time spent: ~5 minutes  

Tools used: browser (URL bar)  

Lessons learned: Never trust URL parameters for access control. Always verify authorization server-side before showing sensitive data.
