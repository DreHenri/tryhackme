I took a look at the website and found the login page that was already interesting:

Login
Show your hacking skills and login to became a CyberHero ! :D


First thing I tried was inspecting the page and then I tried to login as 
admin:admin
admin:password

No results.

But

I took a look at the network tab and nothing appeared. This could mean that the login could be handled purely in JavaScript.
After some looking I found an interesting script:

function authenticate() {
      a = document.getElementById('uname')
      b = document.getElementById('pass')
      const RevereString = str => [...str].reverse().join('');
      if (a.value=="h3ck3rBoi" & b.value==RevereString("54321@terceSrepuS")) { 
        var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
          if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
            document.getElementById("flag").innerHTML = this.responseText ;
            document.getElementById("todel").innerHTML = "";
            document.getElementById("rm").remove() ;
          }
        };
        xhttp.open("GET", "RandomLo0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0gpath12345_Flag_"+a.value+"_"+b.value+".txt", true);
        xhttp.send();
      }
      else {
        alert("Incorrect Password, try again.. you got this hacker !")
      }
    }



I found the username and the password which was reversed.
Then I just had to log in to find the flag.
