**Commands**

-sT (TCP Connect Scan): Performs a full TCP connection using the OS's connect() call — easiest but noisier.

-sS (SYN Scan): Sends SYN packets to start connections but doesn’t complete them — stealthier and faster.

-sU (UDP Scan): Sends UDP packets to detect open UDP ports — slower and less reliable due to no response on open ports.

-sN (TCP Null Scan): Sends packets with no flags set — evades some firewalls, used for OS detection. The -sn switch tells Nmap not to scan any ports -- forcing it to rely primarily on ICMP echo packets

-sF (TCP FIN Scan): Sends FIN flag packets to closed ports — stealthy and can bypass some filters.

-sX (TCP Xmas Scan): Sends packets with FIN, PSH, and URG flags — used to confuse or bypass stateless firewalls.

-v (Verbosity and more information about the scan)

-oN (Save normal output)

--script=ftp-anon (Checks if anonymous login is allowed on an FTP server. If successful, it will list any readable files or directories.)





**Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)**

Categories:
    safe:- Won't affect the target
    intrusive:- Not safe: likely to affect the target
    vuln:- Scan for vulnerabilities
    exploit:- Attempt to exploit a vulnerability
    auth:- Attempt to bypass authentication for running services (e.g. Log into an FTP server anonymously)
    brute:- Attempt to bruteforce credentials for running services
    discovery:- Attempt to query running services for further information about the network (e.g. query an SNMP server).

Example1:
When you use --script=<script-name>, like: 
nmap --script=http-fileupload-exploiter -p 80 <target>
Nmap looks for the script in its default script library, located in: /usr/share/nmap/scripts/

Multiple scripts can be run simultaneously in this fashion by separating them by a comma. For example: --script=smb-enum-users,smb-enum-shares

Example2:
nmap -p 80 --script http-put --script-args http-put.url='/dav/shell.php',http-put.file='./shell.php'

http-put script (used to upload files using the PUT method)
This takes two arguments: the URL to upload the file to, and the file's location on disk.
