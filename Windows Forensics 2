**Windows Prefetch files**

When a program is run in Windows, it stores its information for future use. This stored information is used to load the program quickly in case of frequent use. 
This information is stored in prefetch files which are located in the C:\Windows\Prefetch directory.
Prefetch files have an extension of .pf

To run Prefetch Parser on a file and save the results in a CSV, we can use the following command:

To run Prefetch Parser on a file and save the results in a CSV, we can use the following command:
PECmd.exe -f <path-to-Prefetch-files> --csv <path-to-save-csv>

Similarly, for parsing a whole directory, we can use the following command:
PECmd.exe -d <path-to-Prefetch-directory> --csv <path-to-save-csv>



**Windows 10 Timeline**

Windows 10 stores recently used applications and files in an SQLite database called the Windows 10 Timeline. This data can be a source of information about the last executed programs. 
It contains the application that was executed and the focus time of the application. The Windows 10 timeline can be found at the following location:

C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\ConnectedDevicesPlatform\{randomfolder}\ActivitiesCache.db

We can use the following command to run WxTCmd:

WxTCmd.exe -f <path-to-timeline-file> --csv <path-to-save-csv>



**Windows Jump Lists**

Windows introduced jump lists to help users go directly to their recently used files from the taskbar. We can view jumplists by right-clicking an application's icon in the taskbar, and it will show us the recently opened files in that application. 
This data is stored in the following directory:

C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations

We can use the following command to parse Jumplists using JLECmd.exe:

JLECmd.exe -f <path-to-Jumplist-file> --csv <path-to-save-csv>



**Shortcut Files**

Windows creates a shortcut file for each file opened either locally or remotely. The shortcut files contain information about the first and last opened times of the file and the path of the opened file, along with some other data. Shortcut files can be found in the following locations:

C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\

C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Office\Recent\

We can use the following command to parse shortcut files using LECmd.exe:

LECmd.exe -f <path-to-shortcut-files> --csv <path-to-save-csv>

The creation date of the shortcut file points to the date/time when the file was first opened. The date/time of modification of the shortcut file points to the last time the file was accessed. 



**IE/Edge history**

An interesting thing about the IE/Edge browsing history is that it includes files opened in the system as well, whether those files were opened using the browser or not.
Hence, a valuable source of information on opened files in a system is the IE/Edge history. We can access the history in the following location:

C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\WebCache\WebCacheV*.dat

The files/folders accessed appear with a file:///* prefix in the IE/Edge history.



**Setupapi dev logs for USB devices**

When any new device is attached to a system, information related to the setup of that device is stored in the setupapi.dev.log. This log is present at the following location:

C:\Windows\inf\setupapi.dev.log

This log contains the device serial number and the first/last times when the device was connected.
