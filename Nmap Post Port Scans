Service Detection

-sV (collect and determine service and version information for the open ports)

You can control the intensity with --version-intensity LEVEL where the level ranges between 0, the lightest, and 9, the most complete.
-sV --version-light has an intensity of 2, while -sV --version-all has an intensity of 9.
-sV will force Nmap to proceed with the TCP 3-way handshake and establish the connection.




OS Detection

 OS detection can be enabled using -O
Ex: nmap -sS -O 10.10.207.1 

Nmap needs to find at least one open and one closed port on the target to make a reliable guess. 
Furthermore, the guest OS fingerprints might get distorted due to the rising use of virtualization and similar technologies. Therefore, always take the OS version with a grain of salt.




Traceroute

If you want Nmap to find the routers between you and the target, just add --traceroute

 Standard traceroute starts with a packet of low TTL (Time to Live) and keeps increasing until it reaches the target. 
Nmap’s traceroute starts with a packet of high TTL and keeps decreasing it. 

Ex: nmap -sS --traceroute 10.10.207.1





Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)

A script is a piece of code that does not need to be compiled. In other words, it remains in its original human-readable form and does not need to be converted to machine language.

 Nmap provides support for scripts using the Lua language.

Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) is a Lua interpreter that allows Nmap to execute Nmap scripts written in Lua language.

 Nmap default installation can easily contain close to 600 scripts  -  /usr/share/nmap/scripts

You can specify to use any or a group of these installed scripts; moreover, you can install other user’s scripts and use them for your scans. 
Let’s begin with the default scripts. You can choose to run the scripts in the default category using --script=default or simply adding -sC


## Nmap Script Categories

| **Script Category** | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| auth                | Authentication related scripts                                                  |
| broadcast           | Discover hosts by sending broadcast messages                                    |
| brute               | Performs brute-force password auditing against logins                           |
| default             | Default scripts, same as `-sC`                                                  |
| discovery           | Retrieve accessible information, such as database tables and DNS names          |
| dos                 | Detects servers vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS)                           |
| exploit             | Attempts to exploit various vulnerable services                                 |
| external            | Checks using a third-party service, such as Geoplugin and VirusTotal            |
| fuzzer              | Launch fuzzing attacks                                                          |
| intrusive           | Intrusive scripts such as brute-force attacks and exploitation                  |
| malware             | Scans for backdoors                                                             |
| safe                | Safe scripts that won’t crash the target                                        |
| version             | Retrieve service versions                                                       |
| vuln                | Checks for vulnerabilities or exploit vulnerable services                       |


You can also specify the script by name using --script "SCRIPT-NAME"
or a pattern such as --script "ftp*"  which would include ftp-brute


Ex: sudo nmap -sS -n --script "http-date" 10.10.247.128
http-date -  “Gets the date from HTTP-like services. Also, it prints how much the date differs from local time…”




Saving the Output

the normal format is similar to the output you get on the screen when scanning a target. You can save your scan in normal format by using -oN FILENAME; N stands for normal.

The grepable format has its name from the command grep.  In simple terms, it makes filtering the scan output for specific keywords or terms efficient. You can save the scan result in grepable format using -oG FILENAME
An example use of grep is grep KEYWORD TEXT_FILE
this command will display all the lines containing the provided keyword.

you can save the scan results in XML format using -oX FILENAME. The XML format would be most convenient to process the output in other programs

Conveniently enough, you can save the scan output in all three formats using -oA FILENAME to combine -oN, -oG, and -oX for normal, grepable, and XML.
