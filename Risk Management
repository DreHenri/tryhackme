NIST SP 800-30, the risk management process entails four steps:

    Frame risk: First, we must establish the context within which all risk activities occur.
    Assess risk: We must identify, analyse, and evaluate potential risks and their likelihood and impact. This step is crucial to help decide on a proper response later.
    Respond to risk: We need to take the steps necessary to mitigate the likelihood or impact of the risk. The response depends on many factors, and we will cover them separately.
    Monitor risk: Finally, we continue tracking and evaluating the effectiveness of risk responses, identifying new risks, and ensuring that our risk management activities are effective. Monitoring is an ongoing process, as many criteria might change over time.




    Qualitative Risk Analysis, where we assign ratings to risks. The ratings can be a qualitative adjective, such as high, medium, and low. Alternatively, it can be something symbolic, such as red, yellow, and green.
    Quantitative Risk Analysis, where we assign monetary values and use that as a basis for decision-making.




Quantitative Risk Analysis
Single Loss Expectancy


SLE = AssetValue × EF

Where:

    Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) is the loss incurred due to the realisation of a threat represented as a monetary value.
    Asset Value is the monetary valuation of an asset
    Exposure Factor (EF) is the percentage of loss a realised threat can cause to an asset.


SLE Numeric Example

Consider the following numeric example for a work laptop considering the threat of a ransomware virus.

    Asset Value = $10,000; the laptop is worth $1000, and the data are worth $9000.
    EF = 90%; a ransomware infection would cause all the data to be unusable.

Consequently,

SLE = AssetValue × EF = $10, 000 × 90% = $9, 000.

In other words, a ransomware infection for such a work laptop would cause the company to lose $9000, assuming there is no backup copy.





Annualised Loss Expectancy

However, this information is insufficient for us to decide on countermeasures. We need to find the expected loss per year.

ALE = SLE × ARO

Where:

    Annualised Loss Expectancy (ALE) is the loss the company expects to lose per year due to the threat.
    Annualised Rate of Occurrence (ARO) is the expected number of times this threat is realised yearly, i.e., frequency per year.

Why do we need to calculate ALE? ALE helps us decide whether paying for a particular control or safeguard is justified






ALE Numeric Example

Let’s revisit our example and calculate the ALE.

    We have already calculated the SLE as $9000; we need to figure out how often we expect this incident to happen yearly.
    Based on experience, a work computer is infected with ransomware once every two years. Hence, the annualised rate of occurrence is 0.5.

Consequently,

ALE = SLE × ARO = $9000 × 0.5 = $4, 500.

In simple terms, we expect the ransomware threat to cost us $4500 per laptop per year unless we take proper measures.









Consider again our example of the risk of a laptop getting infected by ransomware. Can we mitigate this risk? We are considering setting up antivirus software on all laptops. The cost is $120 per laptop annually, including the licensing and extra staff hours.



We need to decide whether this countermeasure is justified from the business perspective. To do that, we need to calculate the value of the safeguard. It would be justified from the business perspective only if the value of the safeguard is positive. The value of the safeguard to the organisation is calculated as follows:

ValueofSafeguard = ALEbeforeSafeguard − ALEafterSafeguard − AnnualCostSafeguard

We have already calculated ALE before the safeguard is implemented.

ALEbeforeSafeguard = SLEbeforeSafeguard × ARObeforeSafeguard = $9000 × 0.5 = $4, 500.

Let’s calculate ALE after the safeguard is added:

ALEafterSafeguard = SLEafterSafeguard × AROafterSafeguard

We might need to recalculate SLE in case the implemented safeguard affected the exposure factor (EF):

SLEafterSafeguard = AssetValue × EFafterSafeguard

In this case, the exposure factor (EF) is not expected to change. In other words, installing an antivirus won’t change the damage that a ransomware infection would cause. Consequently, SLE remains the same after the safeguard is implemented:

SLEafterSafeguard = AssetValue × EFafterSafeguard = $10, 000 × 90% = $9, 000.

However, an antivirus would significantly decrease the annualised rate of occurrence (ARO). Let’s say that this antivirus is so efficient that we expect that ARO to become 0.02.

Now we can calculate ALE after the safeguard is added.

ALEafterSafeguard = SLEafterSafeguard × AROafterSafeguard = $9, 000 × 0.02 = $180.

We already estimated the safeguard cost to be $120 per year. Therefore,

ValueofSafeguard = $4, 500 − $180 − $120 = $4, 200.

Because the value of the selected safeguard is positive, we conclude that it is justified from the business perspective. In other words, from the risk analysis perspective, installing an antivirus has a value (benefit) of $4,200 to the organisation.







EXAMPLE:
Asset Information

    Asset: Smartphone

    Asset Value: $1,000 — this is how much the phone is worth to the organization or user.



Risk: Malware

This is the threat you're analyzing — what could go wrong with the asset (e.g., malware infection on the smartphone).





Impact Without Safeguard
Exposure Factor (EF): 5%

This is how much of the asset's value is lost if the risk occurs.
SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)=Asset Value×EF=1000×0.05=50
SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)=Asset Value×EF=1000×0.05=50
Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO): 0.25

This means the malware attack is expected to occur once every 4 years (1 ÷ 0.25 = 4 years).
ALE (Annualized Loss Expectancy) without safeguard:
ALE=SLE×ARO=50×0.25=12.50
ALE=SLE×ARO=50×0.25=12.50

So, without antivirus protection, you'd expect to lose $12.50 per year due to malware.





Safeguard: Antivirus License

    Cost: $50 per year

    New EF after safeguard: 1% (significantly reduced risk impact)

New SLE with antivirus:
SLE=1000×0.01=10
SLE=1000×0.01=10
New ALE:
ALE=10×0.25=2.50
ALE=10×0.25=2.50

So with antivirus, expected annual loss due to malware drops to $2.50.




Cost-Benefit Analysis

Let’s compare costs:

    Loss Reduction: $12.50 → $2.50 = $10 saved annually

    Cost of Safeguard: $50

You’re spending $50 to save $10 annually — so in this case, the safeguard is not cost-effective.
