    Binary Ninja - A tool for disassembling and decompiling binaries.
    PEiD - Packer, cryptor, and compiler detection tool.


Disassemblers & Decompilers
They help analysts understand malicious software’s behaviour, logic, and control flow by breaking it into a more understandable format.

    CFF Explorer - A PE editor designed to analyze and edit Portable Executable (PE) files.
    Hopper Disassembler - A Debugger, disassembler, and decompiler.
